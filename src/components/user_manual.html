            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
            <p>The population on Earth continues to grow while available space for them has not kept up in pace. Overpopulation of 
                <br>cities combined with the lack of real estate development for parking space has created a parking crisis. 
                <br>OpenParking app allows property owners to rent their parking spot at their driveways to users for a period of time. 
                <br>Property owners make money by renting unused space while users can choose from affordable options in comparison to 
                <br>public parking. OpenParking focuses on the convenience of users to utilize parking spaces and contributors earn money 
                <br>renting their vacant spots. By creating a practical, profitable solution, we hope to utilize unused private parking spaces 
                <br>and diffuse the current parking crisis.</p>
            
            <br><p><b>Installation Instructions</b></p>
